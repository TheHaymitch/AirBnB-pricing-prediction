# AirBnB-pricing-prediction
Project
Using scikit-learn, we modeled on Airbnb dataset to estimate prices of Airbnb vacation rentals for the hosts depending on various features like neighborhood, zipcodes, apartment type etc.

The Jupyter notebook in this repo contains examples to run regression estimators on the Inside Airbnb listings dataset from New York. The target variable is the price of the listing. 

To run the scikit-learn examples (without Spark) the following packages are required:

1. Python 2
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. scikit-learn (0.17 or later)
